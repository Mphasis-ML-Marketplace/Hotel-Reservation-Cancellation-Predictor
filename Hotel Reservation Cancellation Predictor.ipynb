    "# Mphasis HyperGraf Hotel Reservation Cancellation Predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "Mphasis HyperGraf Hotel Reservation Cancellation Predictor is an Ensemble Machine Learning algorithm-based solution which predicts the probability of guests cancelling their hotel reservations. Cancellation of scheduled hotel stays is a significant challenge for hospitality companies.Cancellations lead to erroneous demand estimation, room pricing and revenue management. This solution predicts the likelihood of guests cancelling their hotel reservations based on guests' booking information. The Solution assists hospitality companies to maximize occupancy and revenue per available room.\n",
